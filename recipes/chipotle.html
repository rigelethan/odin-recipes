    <h3> A crumbled tofu simmered in a spicy poblano sauce served with brown rice, black beans, pico de gallo and lettuce.</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 small onion</li>
        <li>1 medium poblano chile</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 chipotle pepper and 2 tablespoons adobo sauce (use one 7oz can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>One 14oz package of extra-firm tofu, drained well</li>
        <li>Brown rice, for serving</li>
        <li>Black beans for serving</li>
        <li>Shredded romaine lettuce, for serving</li>
        <li>Prepared pico de gallo, for serving</li>
    </ul> 

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to broil.</li>
        <li>Place the onion wedges and poblano on a rimmed baking sheet and rub with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Broil, turning several times with tongs, until the poblano has collapsed in on itself and the vegetables are charred, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the oven. When the poblano is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin, stem and seeds.</li>
        <li>Transfer the poblano to a blender. Add the charred onion wedges, chipotle pepper and adobo sauce, garlic, soy sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, vinegar, cumin, 1/2 cup water, 3/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Blend until smooth, then set the poblano mixture aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the tofu crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick planks, then press the pieces between a couple paper towels to remove as much moisture as possible. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and cook until well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate to cool. </li>
        <li>Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same skillet, then add the diced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 6 minutes. Using your hands, tear and crumble the tofu into very small pieces and add to the skillet. Cook, stirring to combine, until warmed through, about 2 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add the poblano mixture and 1/2 cup water to the skillet and cook until itâ€™s bubbling all over and the tofu has absorbed some of the sauce, about 5 minutes. Add 1 to 2 more tablespoons water if the mixture gets too dry (it should be saucy). Taste and add more salt and pepper, if needed. </li>
        <li>Serve over rice and beans and top with lettuce and pico de gallo.</li>
    </ol>
